# Backlog

## MVP
- [ ] Rewrite CLI tools in TypeScript/Bun
- [ ] Parser for task format (regex-based per SPEC.md)
- [ ] Basic validation for task format

## Blockers
(none)

## Quick Wins
- [ ] Add subtask documentation to SKILL.md
- [ ] Update deployed skill with new @mentions and _spent: metadata

## Later
- [ ] Time tracking summary command (sum _spent: by tag/date)
- [ ] Due date reminders
- [ ] Task dependencies
- [ ] Recurring tasks
- [ ] Project-specific task file discovery

## Completed
- [x] Initial project setup (2026-01-10)
- [x] Move skill to Arcana namespace (2026-01-10)
- [x] Add @mentions to format spec (2026-01-10)
- [x] Add _spent: time tracking to format spec (2026-01-10)
- [x] Create docs/SPEC.md canonical specification (2026-01-10)

## Issues
- [ ] list-tasks.md and migrate-completed-tasks.md are markdown scripts (unusual pattern)

## Ideas
- Obsidian plugin for task visualization
- Integration with calendar for due dates
- Weekly time report generator
- Task templates
